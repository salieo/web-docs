If you aren't quite pleased with how Salieo is positioning your image you can easily override the crop data for an image.

Simply log into your Salieo account and navigate to your site's dashboard. You'll see a section called **Manage Images**. If you know the URL of the image you want to edit the crops for you can enter it in the search field. You can also choose **Select On Site** to select the image from your site.

By editing the crops, you can change how [salieo.js](https://github.com/salieo/salieo.js) will position/scale the image on your site. Note that you may have to clear your browser's cache to see new changes on your site after you edit the crops for an image.

Salieo uses two types of crops, [suggested](suggestedcrops) and [fallback](fallbackcrops). For more detailed information on how these types of crops affect the image's position and scale on your site, refer to the [cropcalc-js docs](https://github.com/salieo/cropcalc-js#zoom) (cropcalc-js is the library used by salieo.js to calculate the best crop for the images on your site).
