Suggested Crops (highlited in green) define crops that contain all the most critical parts of an image. The smallest suggested crop should contain only the most critical components of an image. Salieo will always attempt to maintain all of the smallest suggested crop in view. If no suggested crops are provided, the entire image is taken as a suggested crop and salieo will attempt to always maintain as much of it as possible when positioning/scaling that image on your site.
